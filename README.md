# Snake Game in Vanilla JavaScript

[DEMO](https://towhidkashem.github.io/snake-game/)

Note: this was built and only tested on the latest version of Chrome on a Windows 10 desktop.

I got a little too into the project and ended up spending longer than the suggested 3 hours. Having never made a game before or worked with the Canvas API it was an interesting project for me.

Overall I'm happy with the way it turned out, the main area of improvement is of course reducing the bloated single class into separate modules (for example a separate class to handle the welcome screen and it's related actions, etc).

Also I would have liked to use SASS in the project and made the page responsive on mobile.
